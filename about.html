            <p>I studied applied math and computer science at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia</a> where I focused on machine learning and what was called “big data” back in the early 2010s. I researched sports analytics with <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/mark-broadie">Professor Mark Broadie</a>, and interned at multiple startups in the Bay Area building recommendation engines, search, and neural network based models.</p>
            <p>After college I joined a startup called <a href="https://www.guidewire.com/products/cyence/">Cyence</a> where I was the only non-PhD on a team of PhDs. We built ML models to quantify cybersecurity risk which we then sold to insurance companies so they could underwrite cybersecurity policies for companies. Cyence eventually got acquired by <a href="https://www.guidewire.com/">Guidewire</a>.</p>
            <p>One of the coolest projects I got to work on was a part time gig as a ML engineer where I consulted with a sports team in one of the big 4 American leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB) to predict player performance over a 5 year horizon. I love sports, so it was fun to combine work and play and ship a model that the front office actually used to evaluate draft prospects and trades.</p>
            <p>After Cyence I decided to join <a href="https://www.coinlist.co">CoinList</a>. I got to build some really interesting fintech infrastructure (both on the crypto side and on the traditional banking integrations side), and we helped many high quality crypto teams (like Solana and Dapper Labs) raise $1B+ for their protocols.</p>
            <p>I got to see what real hyperscaling at a company was when we started serving tens of millions of users a day in 2020 / 2021. I joined as the 15th employee and got the opportunity to lead product and engineering as we grew to 150 people, $200M+ in revenue, and $1B+ in valuation. Then I got to see what a true financial collapse looked like from a front row seat in 2022. It was the best of times and it was the worst of times. </p>
            <p>After CoinList, a close friend and I spent ~9 months exploring ideas for a new company. We built embeddings based search + RAG for private data, a very light prototype for AI enhanced hardware / embeddings systems design, and built a real time multiplayer sudoku app.</p>
            <p>I currently work at <a href="https://attentive.com/">Attentive</a> as a product manager working on LLM output evaluation and leveraging AI to bring conversational commerce to the United States. I decided to join Attentive because it was a fast growing company which can be accelerated by all the new AI tools out there. I know there’s a lot of companies who talk about their new AI strategy, but it’s exciting to be part of a fast moving team who is actually leveraging LLMs in production to drive value to our customers. We’re hiring, so if you’re interested please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>!</p>
