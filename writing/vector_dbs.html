            <h3>Vector DBs ü§ù Multimodality</h3>

            <p>May 25, 2024</p>

            <p>I saw <a href="https://x.com/theethanding/status/1791525067781730330?s=46&t=lWS_f2ZnjGg0AhgzDvP5Pg">this tweet</a> and without thinking I reacted "yikes!". And then I thought about it and I thought "yikes this is really bad for Pinecone".</p>

            <p>I've been a *bit* of a hater on vector DBs for some time now. Not because I don't think they're useful (I use them and think they are great!), but because people see them as a cure-all for their search and retrieval problems when there's potentially better ways to get results you're looking for. But this might be when I become a buyer of vector DB stock (if I could) when the tide seems to be against them.</p>

            <p>While vector DBs might be overkill if you're just searching over a bunch of JSONs, they are super useful when there's more than just text data involved and we're getting ready for a huge influx of video and voice content. GPT-4o is multi-modal and OpenAI is pushing voice. Sora was launched a while ago and we're seeing increasing competition to video and image models. If we're about to be inundated with a ton of voice, video, and text data that we need to efficiently retrieve and serve to users, guess what's going to be the best tool for the job: vector DBs!</p>

            <p>No longer will vector DBs be sad that they wouldn't have fulfilled their purpose (pardon my anthropomorphizing); they'll be able to live productive, happy lives helping serve all the data we can possibly generate.</p>

            <p>We can have a user ask a question (voice), which directly grabs a video as an answer since we can have everything embedded in the same space and stored in a vector DB. <a href="https://scale.com/blog/text-universal-interface">Text might not be the universal interface</a> and vector DBs will have to save us from data overload if that's the case.</p>
