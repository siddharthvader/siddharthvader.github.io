            <h3>Frontiers</h3>
            <p>November 16, 2022</p>
            <p>One of the founding myths of Rome is that it was a few people who fled east after the Trojan war to create the new Troy who ended up in central Italy to create the city that was Rome. This of course is not the popular story of Romulus and Remus that we are used to hearing, but it is another founding myth that is circulated.</p>
            <p>It made me think of how people are constantly looking for another frontier. It is crazy to think that Rome was at one point a frontier city. It was a small settlement which then ballooned into the center of the ancient Western world. Rome is known as the eternal city, but there was a time when it was less than eternal. It didn't even exist. People fled there from elsewhere to create something new.</p>
            <p>Everyone is enamored with new things. People go to new places and explore new ideas because humanity is obsessed with the frontiers of everything. I wonder what the next frontier will be.</p>
